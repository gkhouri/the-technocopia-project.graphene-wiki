# Large Scale Graphene Tape Production using Tape Casting #

### Primary paper ###
The notes on this page come primarily from the paper [[High Surface Area Tapes Produced with Functionalized Graphene|http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn2013723]] published May 5, 2011 in the ACS Nano journal. There exists an accompanying patent titled [[Graphene Tapes|http://www.google.com/patents?id=sxn_AQAAEBAJ&zoom=4&dq=info%3Awq-rxquSfDEJ%3Ascholar.google.com&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false]] held by [[Vorbeck Materials Corp|http:/www.vorbeck.com]] and the Trustees of Princeton University with the authors of the ACS paper listed as the inventors.

### Terminology ###
* **FGS**: [[Functionalized graphene sheets]]
* **Slip**: [[Slip (ceramics)|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_(ceramics)]]

### Introduction to tape casting ###
In this paper, the authors claim to produce a 1 meter long by 15 centimeter wide strip of graphene tape with a thickness in the tens of micrometers (Note: 1.5 oz/ft^2 of copper is about 50 micrometers thick). They do this with tape casting, a method commonly used in the manufacturing of ceramic tapes (**Figure 1**). In tape casting, a thin film is used as a substrate for an aqueous solution/dispersion that is loaded into the hopper. As the tape is pulled under the doctor blade, the blade spreads the solution across the film in an even layer. The film is then pulled under IR lamps or other instruments that evaporate the solvent and dry the composite.

In the case of this research paper, the authors used a glass substrate treated with silane in order to make the graphene tape easier to peel off. They dried the glass substrate covered with the graphene tape at ambient temperature for "several" days before peeling the tape off.

## Tape Casting Materials ##
### Graphene Slip Suspension ###
The graphene tape is cast from a suspension of functionalized graphene sheets (FGS) ([[Vor-X|http://vorbeck.com/functionalized.html]]) and a triblock copolymer surfacant ([[F-127|http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/p2443]]) in a poly(ethylene oxide) ([[PEO, Mv=600000|http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/182028]]) solution.

### Procedure for producing FGS suspension ###
1. Prepare surfacant solution with deionized water (R >16 MOhm). Use 1:1 ratio of surfacant:FGS powder by mass
  * How much deionized water?
2. Prepare FGS suspension in water
  * Again, how much solvent?
3. Over a period of 1 hour, slowly add FGS suspension to surfacant solution under continuous stirring and ultrasonication at 30% power (using [[Vibra-Cell|http://www.sonics.biz/lp-vibra.htm]]) while in an ice bath to prevent heating
4. Centrifuge suspension at 900g for 10 minutes
  * At this point, the concentration of FGS in the suspension is 1.6 wt %. Supposedly this would mean for 10 kg of total suspension, you would have 160 grams of FGS in 4.84 kg of water and 160 grams of surfacant in 4.84 kg of water
5. Transfer to vacuum chamber under slight vacuum and stir to remove entrained air
6. Prepare binder solution with 4.5 wt % of PEO by adding PEO powder to absolute ethanol under continuous stirring at 65C and then adding an equal amount of water
  * 4.5 wt % before or after adding water?
7. Add PEO solution to FGS/surfacant suspension

### Procedure for tape casting suspension ###
1. Mix suspension for at least 2 hours prior to casting
2. Cast with doctor blade assembly ([[SDBA|http://www.drblade.com/drblade.asp]]) with a 1.5mm blade gap in a class 1000 soft wall clean room.
3. Dry tape at ambient temperature for several days

### Thermolysis ###
1. Stack composite tapes by alternating with Grafoil Sheets (GTB grade, 125 micrometer thick) in a graphite-element furnace ([[Model 1000|http://www.thermaltechnology.com/laboratory-furnaces.html?id=94]])
2. Reduce pressure in furnace to 100 mTorr and backfill with dry nitrogen to atmospheric pressure (non-oxidizing environment)
3. Run thermolysis under flowing nitrogen at 2 SCFM (3.4 m^3/h)
4. Heat furnace chamber to 90C at 5C/min and hold for one hour to remove volatiles
5. Heat to 315C at 5C/min and hold for 10 hours

Notes:
* When heating to 1000C, heat at 5C/min
* When heating above ~1237C (when dissociation of nitrogen becomes appreciable), use argon for inert atmosphere.

## Characterization of Graphene Tape ##
Conductivity:
* Ranged from 130 to 24,000 S/m depending on treatment and FGS concentration. 2250C treated (annealed) > 1000 C treated (reduced) > no treatment.
