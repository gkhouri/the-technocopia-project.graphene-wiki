# Self Assembly Method for Graphene Oxide Sponges and Films #

### Primary paper ###
The notes on this page come primarily from the paper [[A Controllable Self-Assembly Method for Large-Scale Synthesis of Graphene Sponges and Free-Standing Graphene Films|http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201000287]] published May 20, 2010 in the journal Advanced Functional Materials.

## Quick Notes (Alex Kiselev) ##
Cool method with no chemicals using just a graphene oxide suspension. Paper says Graphene sponges and tapes but only after reduction/annealing (at high temperatures).

Requires the use of a temperature controlled centrifugre in vacuum (a "speed vacuum concentrator")
